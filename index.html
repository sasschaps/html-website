    <p>Hi there! I'm Sarah. I am from Cape Town, South Africa 🇿🇦. I was born in Durban but grew up in Johannesburg and moved to Cape Town after university.</p>
    <p>Although I grew up in South Africa, my family is from Ireland 🇮🇪 and Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. My first language is English but I can speak some Afrikaans and French too.</p>
    <p>I come from a Humanities background as I majored in Philosophy and English Literature in my undergraduate degree and Journalism in my postgraduate degree
        at <em>Stellenbosch University</em>, which is situated in the Cape Winelands 🍷. 
       I worked as a Digital Copywriter in the marketing industry for the past 6 years. But, I did not enjoy it at all. I've always loved computers 💻 and I recently 
       discovered how much I love programming! 👩🏻‍💻 </p>
    <p>I am currently teaching English online to students based in China, while I complete my Backend Software Engineering Bootcamp.
       I am honoured to be doing this course and I am so excited to add Frontend Development skills to my growing software engineering repertoire 
       and to meet interesting people from around the world! 🌍</p>
